Review the current markdown file (or ask me which file) and optimize it for AI reference according to project standards.

## Optimization Patterns

Apply these proven patterns:

### 1. Add Quick-Reference Tables at Top
Convert verbose lists/sections into scannable tables immediately after intro.

### 2. Compress Multi-Line Answers to Single Lines
Remove verbose explanations, keep core insight + link.

### 3. Table-ize Numeric/List Content
Convert bullet lists into compact tables.

### 4. Remove Redundant Label Phrases
Strip "Definition:", "Primary Location:", etc.

### 5. Shorten Cross-References
Use "See X" instead of "For more details see X".

### 6. Compress Quoted Wisdom
Keep only essential insight, not full quote context.

### 7. Use Arrows & Symbols for Flow
Replace verbose connectors with →, =, |, /.

### 8. Front-Load Critical Info
Move most important content to top of document.

### 9. Compress "Usage" Sections
Turn multi-paragraph usage instructions into 1-2 lines.

### 10. Remove Separator Lines
If using headers, don't need `---` between every entry.
