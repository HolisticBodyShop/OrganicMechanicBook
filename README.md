# The Organic Mechanic

A holistic wellness book exploring how the body works as an integrated system, challenging conventional medical reductionism with a tensegrity-based, fascia-aware approach to understanding pain and movement.

## Project Overview

This repository contains:
- **Source material processing** for book content
- **AI-optimized knowledge base** for research and cross-referencing
- **Claude Code workflows** for content management

## Book Content (Chapters 1-4 Complete)

| Chapter | Title | Core Concepts |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Preface | You Are Light | Energy-matter paradigm, quantum biology foundations |
| Ch 1 | Why the System Can't See You | Medical reductionism critique, body as complex adaptive system |
| Ch 2 | Bones Don't Move Themselves | Tensegrity architecture, force-driven alignment |
| Ch 3 | Fascial Bunching & Kinetic Chain | Fascia as load-sharing network, connected movement chains, joint centration |
| Ch 4 | Pain Is an Encrypted Message | Pain as information signal, systematic assessment |

## Core Philosophy

The book presents a paradigm shift:
- **Pain location ≠ problem source** - symptoms often appear far from root cause
- **Bones don't move themselves** - soft tissue tension governs skeletal alignment
- **Body as tensegrity structure** - continuous tension network, not stacked blocks
- **Pain is signal, not enemy** - nervous system communication, not malfunction

## Workflows

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/book:add-content` | Process new book material into knowledge base |
| `/kb:reindex` | Regenerate KB-INDEX.md |
| `/kb:optimize-md` | Optimize markdown for AI reference |
| `/kb:check-quality` | Run quality checks on knowledge base |
| `/commit-message` | Generate AI-optimized commit messages |

## Getting Started

1. Add book content via `/book:add-content`
2. Query the knowledge base for research
3. Cross-reference using GLOSSARY and NAVIGATION files

## Status

- **Chapters 1-4**: Complete in knowledge base
- **Chapters 5+**: Not yet added
- **Protocols/Templates/Checklists**: Planned, not yet populated
