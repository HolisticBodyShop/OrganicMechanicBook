# Pain Assessment Decision Tree

> **Purpose**: Systematic approach to tracing pain signals upstream to find drivers rather than treating symptoms.

---

## Quick Reference

| Node | Question | Actions |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Acute tissue damage? | YES → Allow healing / NO → Continue |
| 2 | Force being mismanaged? | YES → Address mechanics / NO → Continue |
| 3 | Nervous system sensitized? | YES → Address neural / NO → Resolve mechanically |

## Node 1: Is There Acute Tissue Damage?

### Assessment

| Indicator | Suggests Damage | Suggests No Damage |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Recent trauma | Yes | No |
| Visible swelling | Yes | Minimal/none |
| Bruising | Yes | No |
| Specific mechanism | Yes | Insidious onset |
| Inflammatory signs | Present | Absent |

### If YES → Protective Pain

This is **adaptive pain**:
- Short-term
- Proportional to injury
- Serves protective function

**Action**: Allow healing, protect tissue, support recovery.

### If NO → Proceed to Node 2

Pain without acute damage requires upstream investigation.

---

## Node 2: Is Force Being Mismanaged?

### Assessment Questions

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| What movements provoke pain? | Loading patterns |
| Is there positional component? | Force concentration |
| Are there postural asymmetries? | Chronic loading bias |
| Is there joint decentration? | Mechanical dysfunction |
| Is there fascial restriction? | Force transmission issues |

### Signs of Force Mismanagement

| Sign | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Positional pain | Joint off-center |
| Movement-related pain | Force during activity |
| Asymmetrical tension | Uneven loading |
| Compensation patterns | Force redistribution |
| Progressive worsening | Accumulating stress |

### If YES → Mechanical Driver

Nociceptors are firing repeatedly due to:
- Abnormal force concentration
- Joint decentration
- Fascial restriction
- Kinetic chain dysfunction

**Action**: Address mechanical drivers, restore force distribution.

### If NO → Proceed to Node 3

---

## Node 3: Has the Nervous System Sensitized?

### Signs of Central Sensitization

| Sign | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Allodynia** | Pain from non-painful stimuli |
| **Hyperalgesia** | Excessive pain from mild stimuli |
| **Widespread pain** | Beyond original site |
| **Disproportionate pain** | Out of proportion to findings |
| **Persistence** | Continues without ongoing damage |

### Sensitization Indicators

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Duration > 3 months | Time for neural changes |
| Multiple failed treatments | Not purely mechanical |
| Emotional component | Fear, catastrophizing |
| Autonomic signs | Sweating, color changes |
| Sleep disruption | Central involvement |

### If YES → Central Sensitization

Pain persists without tissue damage due to:
- Altered spinal cord processing
- Changed brain interpretation
- Lowered thresholds
- Amplified signals

**Action**: Address neural programming, desensitization approaches.

### If NO → Mechanical Resolution Possible

Should respond to mechanical intervention if properly targeted.

## Pain Signal Flow Reference

```
Input (mechanical/chemical/thermal)
              │
              ▼
    Peripheral Receptors
    (nociceptors, mechanoreceptors)
              │
              ▼
      Peripheral Nerve
              │
              ▼
        Spinal Cord
    (modulation + amplification)
              │
              ▼
          Brain
    (context + threat evaluation)
              │
              ▼
      PAIN EXPERIENCE
```

**Critical**: Pain is interpreted by the brain, not generated at the tissue.

## Context Factors Affecting Pain Interpretation

| Factor | How It Influences |
|--------|-------------------|
| Past injury | Sensitization history |
| Emotional state | Amplification/suppression |
| Postural memory | Pattern recognition |
| Threat perception | Danger assessment |
| Neural sensitization | Threshold changes |
| Autonomic tone | Fight/flight/freeze |

---

## Clinical Application

### Step 1: Rule Out Red Flags

| Red Flag | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Recent significant trauma | Medical evaluation |
| Night pain/rest pain | Rule out pathology |
| Unexplained weight loss | Medical evaluation |
| Neurological deficit | Medical evaluation |
| Fever | Rule out infection |

### Step 2: Apply Decision Tree

Work through nodes systematically.

### Step 3: Match Intervention to Finding

| Finding | Intervention Focus |
|---------|-------------------|
| Acute damage | Tissue healing |
| Force mismanagement | Mechanical correction |
| Sensitization | Neural reprogramming |
| Mixed | Multi-modal approach |

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Treating pain site | May miss driver |
| Assuming imaging = pain | Correlation ≠ causation |
| Ignoring sensitization | Mechanical alone won't work |
| Ignoring mechanics | Neural alone won't work |
| Single-approach thinking | Complex problems need integrated solutions |

## Integration with Other Concepts

| Concept | Integration Point |
|---------|-------------------|
| [Kinetic Chain](../structures/kinetic-chain.md) | Where is force actually mismanaged? |
| [Joint Centration](../structures/joint-centration.md) | Is joint off-center? |
| [Fascial Bunching](../structures/fascial-bunching.md) | Is force transmission altered? |
| [Body as System](../concepts/body-as-system.md) | What systems are involved? |
