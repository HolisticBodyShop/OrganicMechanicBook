# Case: The Frozen Shoulder That Wasn't

> **Key Lesson**: Local stiffness is often remote binding.

---

## Quick Reference

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Client** | 46-year-old female |
| **Complaint** | Shoulder pain, limited overhead motion |
| **Previous diagnosis** | Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) |
| **Actual findings** | Rib and diaphragm restriction |
| **Resolution** | ROM restored without aggressive shoulder stretching |

---

## Presentation

### Chief Complaint
- Shoulder pain
- Limited overhead motion
- Difficulty with daily activities

### Previous Diagnosis
**Adhesive capsulitis** (frozen shoulder)
- Given elsewhere
- Standard treatment was being recommended

---

## Assessment Findings

| Finding | Location | Significance |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Rib cage restriction | Opposite side | Altered thorax mechanics |
| Diaphragm asymmetry | Breathing pattern | Connected to rib restriction |
| Fascial binding | Rib → lat → shoulder capsule | Mechanical tether to shoulder |

### The Pattern

```
Rib cage restricted (opposite side)
              ↓
Diaphragm asymmetry develops
              ↓
Fascial binding forms
              ↓
Latissimus affected
              ↓
Shoulder capsule tethered
              ↓
Overhead motion limited
              ↓
Misdiagnosed as "frozen shoulder"
```

## Analysis

### Why It Wasn't Frozen Shoulder

True adhesive capsulitis involves:
- Capsular inflammation and fibrosis
- Progressive phases (freezing, frozen, thawing)
- Intra-articular pathology

This case had:
- **Mechanical tethering** from distant restriction
- Fascial binding, not capsular adhesion
- Remote driver, not local pathology

### The Fascial Connection

| Structure | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Ribs | Provide base for lat attachment |
| Latissimus dorsi | Connects rib cage to humerus |
| Fascial continuity | Links rib motion to shoulder capsule |

When ribs can't move freely:
- Lat can't function normally
- Fascial tension transmits to shoulder
- Shoulder becomes "stuck" by remote tether

---

## Treatment Approach

### What Was NOT Done
- Aggressive shoulder stretching
- Shoulder manipulation
- Direct shoulder joint treatment
- Standard frozen shoulder protocol

### What WAS Done

| Intervention | Target | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Rib mobilization | Opposite side ribs | Restore thorax mechanics |
| Diaphragm work | Breathing pattern | Address asymmetry |
| Fascial release | Rib-lat-shoulder chain | Free the tether |

---

## Outcome

### Result
- Shoulder ROM returned
- Pain resolved
- **Without aggressive shoulder stretching**

### Key Point

> "The shoulder wasn't frozen. It was mechanically tethered."

---

## Clinical Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Diagnosis ≠ Mechanism
"Frozen shoulder" described the symptom, not the cause.

### 2. Fascial Bunching Creates Remote Effects
Rib restriction → lat involvement → shoulder limitation.

### 3. Aggressive Local Treatment Can Be Unnecessary
Once the tether was released, the shoulder freed itself.

### 4. Contralateral Problems Can Cause Ipsilateral Symptoms
Opposite side rib restriction caused same-side shoulder limitation.

## Differential: True vs. Mechanical "Frozen Shoulder"

| Feature | True Adhesive Capsulitis | Mechanical Restriction |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Capsular pattern | Yes (ER > Abd > IR) | May not follow pattern |
| Response to stretch | Slow, follows phases | May respond quickly |
| Remote restrictions | Not primary cause | Often present |
| Fascial binding | Secondary | Primary mechanism |
| Thorax involvement | Incidental | Causal |

---

## Takeaway

> "Local stiffness is often remote binding."

When shoulder doesn't respond to local treatment:
1. Assess the rib cage (both sides)
2. Evaluate breathing pattern and diaphragm
3. Trace fascial connections to shoulder
4. Consider that the "frozen" joint may be tethered, not adhered
