# Case: Chronic Neck Pain After a "Healed" Ankle Sprain

> **Key Lesson**: The nervous system will sacrifice comfort to preserve movement.

---

## Quick Reference

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Client** | 34-year-old runner |
| **History** | Ankle sprain 3 years prior |
| **Complaint** | Daily neck stiffness and headaches |
| **Actual findings** | Residual ankle instability driving compensation |
| **Resolution** | Under 6 weeks with ankle proprioception work |

---

## Presentation

### Chief Complaint
- Daily neck stiffness
- Headaches
- Ongoing for extended period

### Relevant History
- Ankle sprain 3 years ago
- Considered "healed"
- Runner (high repetition activity)

---

## Assessment Findings

| Finding | Location | Significance |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Residual instability | Ankle | Never fully rehabilitated |
| Altered gait timing | Walking/running | Compensation for ankle |
| Compensatory rotation | Pelvis | Adapting to gait changes |
| Muscle overactivation | Cervical muscles | Stabilizing a walking problem |

### The Pattern

```
Ankle sprain (3 years ago)
           ↓
"Healed" but residual instability
           ↓
Altered gait timing (thousands of steps/day)
           ↓
Compensatory pelvic rotation
           ↓
Spinal compensation travels up
           ↓
Cervical muscles overactivate to stabilize
           ↓
Daily neck stiffness + headaches
```

## Analysis

### Why a "Healed" Ankle Caused Neck Pain

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ankle "healed"** | Ligaments repaired, but proprioception compromised |
| **Running continued** | High repetition magnified small dysfunction |
| **3 years of compensation** | Pattern deeply ingrained |
| **Neck as stabilizer** | Final compensation in chain |

### The Kinetic Chain

| Level | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ankle | Unstable (proprioception deficit) |
| Knee | Compensating for ankle |
| Hip | Compensating for knee |
| Pelvis | Rotating abnormally |
| Lumbar spine | Adapting to pelvis |
| Thoracic spine | Adapting to lumbar |
| Cervical spine | Final compensation |
| Neck muscles | Overworking |

### Critical Insight

> "The neck was stabilizing a walking problem."

---

## Treatment Approach

### What Was NOT Done
- Direct neck treatment as primary focus
- Neck strengthening
- Cervical manipulation
- Headache-focused treatment

### What WAS Done

| Intervention | Target | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Proprioception retraining | Ankle | Address original dysfunction |
| Balance exercises | Ankle/foot | Restore stability input |
| Gait retraining | Walking pattern | Normalize timing |

---

## Outcome

| Timeframe | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Under 6 weeks | Neck symptoms eliminated |

### Key Point

> "Correcting ankle proprioception eliminated neck symptoms in under 6 weeks."

---

## Clinical Principles Demonstrated

### 1. "Healed" ≠ Fully Functional
Tissue healing doesn't guarantee restoration of proprioception and motor control.

### 2. Compensation Accumulates
Three years of altered gait created deeply ingrained patterns.

### 3. The Body Prioritizes Movement Over Comfort
The nervous system kept the runner running—at the cost of neck comfort.

### 4. High Repetition Magnifies Small Errors
Running: thousands of steps × small compensation = significant adaptation.

### 5. Distal Dysfunction Can Cause Proximal Symptoms
Ankle → neck is the full length of the kinetic chain.

---

## The Time Factor

### Why 3 Years of Neck Pain?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Initial ankle sprain | Created instability |
| Return to running | Loaded dysfunctional pattern |
| Compensation developed | Body adapted to preserve running |
| Pattern reinforced | Became "normal" |
| Neck symptoms appeared | Final link overloaded |

### Why 6 Weeks to Resolve?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Addressed actual driver | Ankle proprioception |
| Proprioception retrains | ~4-6 weeks typical |
| Compensation unwound | Body reorganized |
| Neck no longer needed | To compensate |

---

## Takeaway

> "The nervous system will sacrifice comfort to preserve movement."

When neck pain doesn't respond to neck treatment:
1. Take thorough injury history (even old, "healed" injuries)
2. Assess the entire kinetic chain, including feet/ankles
3. Look for gait abnormalities
4. Consider that the neck may be the victim, not the cause
5. Address the driver, even if it seems unrelated
