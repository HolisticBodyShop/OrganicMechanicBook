## A

### Allodynia
Pain from stimuli that are not normally painful. A sign of central sensitization.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Autonomic Tone
The baseline activity level of the autonomic nervous system (fight/flight/freeze). Influences pain interpretation.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

---

## B

### Bio-electromagnetic Field
The human body's electromagnetic field generated by the nervous system. What ancient traditions referred to as an "aura."

**See**: [you-are-light.md](paradigm/you-are-light.md)

### Biotensegrity
Application of tensegrity principles to biological structures. The body maintains stability through continuous tension (muscles/fascia) with compression elements (bones) floating within.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

---

## C

### Central Sensitization
Condition where the central nervous system amplifies pain signals. Pain persists even after tissue healing because signal pathways remain altered.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md), [pain-decision-tree.md](reference/pain-decision-tree.md)

### Complex Adaptive System
A network of interacting subsystems that influence each other continuously. The human body is a complex adaptive system.

**See**: [body-as-system.md](concepts/body-as-system.md)

### Compression Strut
In tensegrity, an element that resists compression. In the body, bones serve as compression struts.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

---

## D

### Decentration
Loss of optimal joint positioning under load. Causes uneven force distribution, cartilage edge loading, and nerve irritation.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

---

## E

### Emergent Property
A characteristic that arises from system interactions rather than individual parts. Pain is an emergent property of multiple body systems.

**See**: [body-as-system.md](concepts/body-as-system.md)

---

## F

### Fascia
Continuous connective tissue web throughout the body. Not just packaging—a load-sharing network with piezoelectric properties.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Fascial Bunch
Adaptive binding of adjacent tissues when a muscle underperforms. Couples muscles that should act independently, transmits force across unintended pathways.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Fascial Lines (Anatomy Trains)
Continuous myofascial pathways through the body (superficial front/back lines, lateral line, spiral line, deep front line). Force travels along these lines.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Force Mismanagement
Uneven distribution of mechanical forces over time. A primary driver of chronic pain.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md), [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

---

## G

---

## H

### Hyperalgesia
Excessive pain response to mildly painful stimuli. A sign of central sensitization.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

---

## I

---

## J

### Joint Centration
The optimal positioning of joint surfaces under load—maximal surface contact, balanced co-contraction, minimal shearing forces.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

---

## K

### Kinetic Chain
The interconnected series of joints, muscles, fascia, and nerves that work together to produce movement. The body moves in chains, not isolated joints.

**See**: [kinetic-chain.md](structures/kinetic-chain.md)

---

## L

---

## M

### Mechanoreceptor
Sensory receptor that converts mechanical stimuli (pressure, stretch) into electrical signals.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Motor Recruitment Order
The sequence in which muscles are activated for a movement. Timing often matters more than strength.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

---

## N

### Neural Sensitization
Changes in nerve sensitivity that lower the threshold for pain signals. Can persist after tissue healing.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Nociceptor
Sensory receptor that responds to potentially damaging stimuli. Converts input to electrical signals interpreted as pain.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

---

## O

---

## P

### Palpation
Manual assessment of tissue through touch. The only method that can assess tissue tone, fascial glide, temperature gradients, and dynamic response to force.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md)

### Piezoelectric
Property of generating electrical charge in response to mechanical stress. Fascia has piezoelectric properties.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Proprioception
The sense of body position and movement. Essential for joint centration and motor control.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

---

## Q

---

## R

### Reductionism
The approach of understanding complex systems by breaking them into smaller parts. Powerful for acute conditions, limited for chronic dysfunction.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md)

---

## S

### Spiral Mechanics
Human movement is fundamentally spiral-based (walking, breathing, throwing). When one spiral dominates, joints twist abnormally.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

---

## T

### Tensegrity
Structural principle where stability comes from continuous tension rather than rigid compression. The body is a tensegrity structure.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

### Tension Element
In tensegrity, components that provide continuous tension. In the body, muscles and fascia serve as tension elements.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

---

## U

---

## V

### Vector Field
Muscles don't pull in simple straight lines—they produce combinations of compression, shear, and torque. Multiple muscle vectors sum to create movement.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

### Viscoelastic
Property of materials that exhibit both viscous (time-dependent) and elastic behaviors. Fascia is viscoelastic.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)
