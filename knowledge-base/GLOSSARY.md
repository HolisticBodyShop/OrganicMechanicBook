## A

### Allodynia
Pain from stimuli that are not normally painful. A sign of central sensitization.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Autonomic Tone
The baseline activity level of the autonomic nervous system (fight/flight/freeze). Influences pain interpretation.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

---

## B

### Behavior Loop
The fundamental pattern by which the body learns and repeats actions: Cue → Program → Outcome → Reinforcement. Explains why patterns persist and why conscious effort fails to override automation.

**See**: [behavior-loops.md](concepts/behavior-loops.md)

### Bio-electromagnetic Field
The human body's electromagnetic field generated by the nervous system. What ancient traditions referred to as an "aura."

**See**: [you-are-light.md](paradigm/you-are-light.md)

### Biotensegrity
Application of tensegrity principles to biological structures. The body maintains stability through continuous tension (muscles/fascia) with compression elements (bones) floating within.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

---

## C

### Central Sensitization
Condition where the central nervous system amplifies pain signals. Pain persists even after tissue healing because signal pathways remain altered.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md), [pain-decision-tree.md](reference/pain-decision-tree.md)

### Complex Adaptive System
A network of interacting subsystems that influence each other continuously. The human body is a complex adaptive system.

**See**: [body-as-system.md](concepts/body-as-system.md)

### Compression Strut
In tensegrity, an element that resists compression. In the body, bones serve as compression struts.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

---

## D

### Decentration
Loss of optimal joint positioning under load. Causes uneven force distribution, cartilage edge loading, and nerve irritation.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

---

## E

### Emergent Property
A characteristic that arises from system interactions rather than individual parts. Pain is an emergent property of multiple body systems.

**See**: [body-as-system.md](concepts/body-as-system.md)

---

## F

### Fascia
Continuous connective tissue web throughout the body. Not just packaging—a load-sharing network with piezoelectric properties.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Fascial Bunch
Adaptive binding of adjacent tissues when a muscle underperforms. Couples muscles that should act independently, transmits force across unintended pathways.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Fascial Lines (Anatomy Trains)
Continuous myofascial pathways through the body (superficial front/back lines, lateral line, spiral line, deep front line). Force travels along these lines.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Force Mismanagement
Uneven distribution of mechanical forces over time. A primary driver of chronic pain.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md), [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

---

## G

---

## H

### Hyperalgesia
Excessive pain response to mildly painful stimuli. A sign of central sensitization.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

---

## I

---

## J

### Joint Centration
The optimal positioning of joint surfaces under load—maximal surface contact, balanced co-contraction, minimal shearing forces.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

---

## K

### Kinetic Chain
The interconnected series of joints, muscles, fascia, and nerves that work together to produce movement. The body moves in chains, not isolated joints.

**See**: [kinetic-chain.md](structures/kinetic-chain.md)

---

## L

---

## M

### Mechanoreceptor
Sensory receptor that converts mechanical stimuli (pressure, stretch) into electrical signals.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Mechanotransduction
The process by which tissues convert mechanical force (shear, compression, torsion, tension) into electrical signals. Enables the body to sense and respond to mechanical loads.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Motor Memory
Stored movement patterns that run automatically after sufficient repetition. Each repetition reinforces muscle firing order, fascial tension patterns, and joint loading. "Bad posture feels right because it is familiar."

**See**: [posture-as-program.md](concepts/posture-as-program.md), [behavior-loops.md](concepts/behavior-loops.md)

### Motor Recruitment Order
The sequence in which muscles are activated for a movement. Timing often matters more than strength.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

---

## N

### Neural Sensitization
Changes in nerve sensitivity that lower the threshold for pain signals. Can persist after tissue healing.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Nociceptor
Sensory receptor that responds to potentially damaging stimuli. Converts input to electrical signals interpreted as pain.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

---

## O

---

## P

### Pain Encryption
Model describing how original pain signals become obscured through multiple layers: mechanical distortion → fascial adaptation → neural modulation → brain interpretation. Treating pain at layer 4 ignores layers 1-3.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Palpation
Manual assessment of tissue through touch. The only method that can assess tissue tone, fascial glide, temperature gradients, and dynamic response to force.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md)

### Piezoelectric
Property of generating electrical charge in response to mechanical stress. Fascia has piezoelectric properties.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Posture Stack
Four-layer software architecture for postural control: (1) Conscious Control (weakest), (2) Motor Programs, (3) Reflexes, (4) Sensory Input. Most correction attempts fail because they target Level 1.

**See**: [posture-as-program.md](concepts/posture-as-program.md)

### Proprioception
The sense of body position and movement. Essential for joint centration and motor control.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

---

## Q

---

## R

### Reductionism
The approach of understanding complex systems by breaking them into smaller parts. Powerful for acute conditions, limited for chronic dysfunction.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md)

---

## S

### Safety Gate
Nervous system checkpoint that evaluates "Is this safe?" before allowing any loop or pattern to update. If the answer is uncertain, old patterns persist and new patterns are rejected. Explains why stretching feels threatening and corrections feel exhausting.

**See**: [behavior-loops.md](concepts/behavior-loops.md), [posture-as-program.md](concepts/posture-as-program.md)

### Spiral Mechanics
Human movement is fundamentally spiral-based (walking, breathing, throwing). When one spiral dominates, joints twist abnormally.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

---

## T

### Tensegrity
Structural principle where stability comes from continuous tension rather than rigid compression. The body is a tensegrity structure.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

### Tension Element
In tensegrity, components that provide continuous tension. In the body, muscles and fascia serve as tension elements.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

---

## U

---

## V

### Vector Field
Muscles don't pull in simple straight lines—they produce combinations of compression, shear, and torque. Multiple muscle vectors sum to create movement.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

### Viscoelastic
Property of materials that exhibit both viscous (time-dependent) and elastic behaviors. Fascia is viscoelastic.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)
