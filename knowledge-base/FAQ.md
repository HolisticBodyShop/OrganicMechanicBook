## Core Concepts

### Q: Why doesn't my pain match my imaging (MRI/X-ray)?

Pain is a **signal-processing outcome**, not a direct measure of tissue damage. Some people have severe imaging findings with no pain; others have severe pain with "normal" imaging. The brain interprets signals in context.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Q: What does "you are light" mean?

It's the book's core philosophy: you are energy slowed into three-dimensional form (E=mc²). Healing happens at the meeting point of structure and energy, not exclusively in either realm.

**See**: [you-are-light.md](paradigm/you-are-light.md)

### Q: Why is modern medicine "incomplete"?

Medicine uses reductionism—breaking systems into parts. This works for discrete problems (fractures, tumors) but fails for chronic pain, which is an emergent property of multiple interacting systems.

**See**: [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md)

## Body Mechanics

### Q: Why don't adjustments/treatments hold?

**Bones don't move themselves.** They go where force is repeated and tension is dominant. Unless the force environment changes (muscle balance, neural patterns, fascial glide), the joint will return to its previous state.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

### Q: What is tensegrity and why does it matter?

The body is a **tension-based structure**, not a stack of bones. Stability comes from continuous tension (muscles/fascia) with bones floating as compression struts. If tension is uneven anywhere, the whole structure deforms.

**See**: [tensegrity.md](structures/tensegrity.md)

### Q: What is a fascial bunch?

When a muscle underperforms, fascia **adapts by binding adjacent tissues together**. This couples muscles that should act independently and transmits force across unintended pathways. It feels "deep" and doesn't stretch out.

**See**: [fascial-bunching.md](structures/fascial-bunching.md)

### Q: What is the kinetic chain?

The body moves in **chains, not isolated joints**. When one link fails to manage load, another absorbs it. Pain appears where force accumulates, not necessarily where it originates.

**See**: [kinetic-chain.md](structures/kinetic-chain.md)

### Q: What is joint centration?

The **optimal positioning of joint surfaces under load**—maximal contact, balanced muscle co-contraction, minimal shearing. Joints don't "remember" alignment; they obey current force rules.

**See**: [joint-centration.md](structures/joint-centration.md)

## Pain Understanding

### Q: Why does my pain move around?

When you change one thing, the system rebalances force. If you stretch a tight muscle that was stabilizing an unstable joint, tension may increase elsewhere. **The pain migrated; the system didn't heal.**

**See**: [kinetic-chain.md](structures/kinetic-chain.md), [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

### Q: Why does pain persist after tissue heals?

**Central sensitization**: the nervous system can remain "wound up" after tissue heals. Signal pathways remain altered. This is neurophysiological, not psychosomatic.

**See**: [pain-as-signal.md](concepts/pain-as-signal.md)

### Q: How do I trace where my pain is actually coming from?

Use the **pain decision tree**: (1) Is there acute damage? (2) Is force being mismanaged? (3) Has the nervous system sensitized? Each answer leads to different intervention.

**See**: [pain-decision-tree.md](reference/pain-decision-tree.md)

## Treatment Questions

### Q: Why isn't stretching helping my tight muscles?

Muscles become tight **for reasons**: to stabilize unstable joints, compensate for weak muscles, or protect vulnerable tissues. Stretching a stabilizer makes the joint less stable, and the nervous system tightens something else.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md)

### Q: Why doesn't strengthening fix my pain?

**Strength ≠ control.** The nervous system recruits muscles based on timing and habit, not just capacity. A weaker muscle firing on time outperforms a stronger muscle firing late. Strengthening without fixing timing reinforces dysfunction.

**See**: [bones-dont-move.md](structures/bones-dont-move.md), [case-strong-broken-athlete.md](case-studies/case-strong-broken-athlete.md)

### Q: My imaging shows degeneration—do I need surgery?

Not necessarily. Degeneration often accelerates where **rotation is trapped** or force is mismanaged. Restoring rotational balance can significantly reduce pain even with severe imaging findings.

**See**: [case-bone-on-bone-hip.md](case-studies/case-bone-on-bone-hip.md)

## Case-Specific

### Q: Can knee pain come from somewhere other than the knee?

Yes. Common drivers include foot pronation, hip anterior glide, and fascial restriction in the thigh. The knee is often absorbing force from above and below, not the source of dysfunction.

**See**: [case-perfect-mri-knee.md](case-studies/case-perfect-mri-knee.md)

### Q: Can an old ankle injury cause neck pain?

Yes. A "healed" ankle with residual instability alters gait timing, which creates compensatory patterns traveling up through the pelvis and spine. The neck may be stabilizing a walking problem.

**See**: [case-chronic-neck-pain.md](case-studies/case-chronic-neck-pain.md)

### Q: Is my frozen shoulder really frozen?

It might be **mechanically tethered** rather than truly adhesive. Rib restriction, diaphragm asymmetry, and fascial binding from rib → lat → shoulder capsule can limit motion without true capsular adhesion.

**See**: [case-frozen-shoulder.md](case-studies/case-frozen-shoulder.md)

---

## Book-Specific

### Q: What is this book's core argument?

The body is intelligent and adaptive. Pain is meaningful information. Structure and energy must be addressed together. The goal is to **complete the picture medicine cannot see alone**, not replace medicine.

**See**: [you-are-light.md](paradigm/you-are-light.md), [reductionism-limits.md](paradigm/reductionism-limits.md)
